Often it is necessary to patch a small use case for a repository as they have not released, or a fix you have already created a Pull-Request for with the desired fix.

For this bazel allows you to patch external repositories.

## Patching bazel repositories

When patching bazel repositories that are installed via a `http_archive` you can simply add the `patches` property with the paths.

```python
http_archive(
    name = "build_bazel_rules_nodejs",
    sha256 = RULES_NODEJS_SHA256,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/releases/download/%s/rules_nodejs-%s.tar.gz" % (RULES_NODEJS_VERSION, RULES_NODEJS_VERSION),
    patches = [
      "//:rules_nodejs-js-named-module-info.patch",
      "//:rules_nodejs-npm-ci.patch"
    ]
)
```

You can create a patch by performing following actions:

1. going to the repository (clone the repository first)
2. checkout the tag you are using
3. perform the change you want
4. run `git diff > ~/path/to/your-patch-file.patch`
5. remove the `a/` and `b/` occurrences in the paths.
6. place the generated file into the repository and check it in

**NOTE**: If you add files they won't occur in the diff as they are untracked. In this case just add all files with `git add .` and then run `git diff --cached  > ~/path/to/your-patch-file.patch`. 

A patch file can look like this:

```patch
diff --git internal/npm_install/npm_install.bzl internal/npm_install/npm_install.bzl
index 7bbe1297..43ecf2ec 100644

```

When you run the next bazel command it will automatically apply your patch.

## Patching bazel files that are managed through npm

If you want to apply a patch in a repsoitory that is managed by npm like `@bazel/typescript` you can leverage the `patch-package` npm package.

1. Install the package with `npm i -D patch-package`. If you have to patch something in your shipped dependencies then remove the `-D` in the install command.
2. Go to the `node_modules` folder inside you package and apply your changes.
3. Run `npx patch-package ${package-name}` this will create a folder `patches` with your patched changes.
4. Add the `patch-package` to the postinstall script of your package. If you need to patch a dependency that is used in production as well be sure to include the postinstall in the shipped `package.json` as well.
